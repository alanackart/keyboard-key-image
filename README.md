The icons set  for different keys in keyboard. All the icon set are painted by myself based on images from [link](https://github.com/q2apro/keyboard-keys-speedflips).
Below is the readme from those images:

      Note
    
      I am using the keys for all screencast videos I am doing for speedflips com and overlay my tutorial videos with these shortcut graphics. Check out one of the videos to get an idea.
    
      For my screencasts in size 1280 x 720, I am using the 300 dpi versions.
    
      If you have any suggestions for improving the graphics, comment in the github repo.
    
      Have fun and do good! ~~ Kai
